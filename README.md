# atlas-of-surface-textures
A working space for the design and implementation of an atlas for surface textures based. Essentially based on solid earth surface data, but extensible to planetary surfaces and others. The starting point is a collection of DEM tiles, but it could be extended to other formats such as lidar point clouds.
